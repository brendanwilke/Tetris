# Tetris

**Description**

This program is an attempt to recreate the classic Tetris game. Complete an entire row to get it removed from your gridspace and keep going to get the highest score possible.

**Necessary Installations**

Java IDE (preferrably Eclipse)

**Usage**

To play the game, run the Window.java file in your IDE of choice. A title screen will appear with the controls for the game. This includes:
* **Left Arrow:** Move your block left
* **Right Arrow:** Move your block right
* **Up Arrow:** Rotate your block
* **Down Arrow:** Speed up your block

Once you have familiarized yourself with the controls, click play and begin playing the game. Every row cleared is worth 2 points. The user can click on the refresh icon which refreshes the game, or the pause icon which pauses the game.
